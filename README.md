# HealthMap_personalRepo
Copy of the Student Services Health & Wellness map I worked on as a coordinator from Sept. 2018-2019.
Inside the /expresswrapper/server.js file, you can see the postgres queries I wrote (to the GIC PostgreSQL database I made) as well as some
Node.JS programming to issue the queries from the back-end to the database.
